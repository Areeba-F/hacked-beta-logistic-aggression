# Project for HackED Beta - By Logistic Aggression

## Description

In this project, we used logistic regression (hence the team name) to train a
model (based on a particular dataset) to predict heart disease based on the
following factors:

* Age
* Biological sex at birth
* Height
* Weight
* Systolic blood pressure
* Diastolic blood pressure
* Cholesterol level (categorical; choices are "normal", "above normal", and "well above normal")
* Blood glucose level (categorical; choices are "normal", "above normal", and "well above normal")
* Whether or not a person smokes
* Whether or not a person drinks alcohol
* Whether or not a person exercises regularly

Based on the prediction, the application recommends potential next steps with
links to resources that a person can use to get potential help or get more
information about cardiovascular disease.
